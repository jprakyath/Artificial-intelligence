PACMAN - Implementation of search algorithms:

    Depth-first search;
    Breadth-first search;
    Greedy best-first search;
    A* search. 

Tha mazes can be found in the input folder. The Pacman is indicated by the "P" icon and the goal state is a dot. The maze layout will be given in simple text format, where '%' stands for walls, 'P' for the starting position, and '.' for the goal (see sample maze file). All step costs are equal to one.

For greedy and A* search, the Manhattan distance from the current position to the goal is used as the heuristic function. 

To run the algorithms, execute the following commands:

	$ make
	$ ./MazeSearch input/example-maze

The output can be seen on the terminal.
